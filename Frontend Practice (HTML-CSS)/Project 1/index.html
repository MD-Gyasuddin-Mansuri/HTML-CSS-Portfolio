          <h2>First monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal</h2>
          <p>
            As the eldest son of King Nara Bhupal Shah, Prithvi Narayan Shah was
            the crown prince and heir to the throne of Gorkha. But, it is
            believed that Brinda Keshar Shah, the son of King Nara Bhupal Shah
            and another queen Buddhimati, got on the womb first. But, Prithvi
            Narayan Shah was born earlier in the seventh month of his mother's
            pregnancy. This created a huge discussion among the people regarding
            the selection of the crown prince of the state. The final decision
            was at King Nara Bhupal Shah's discretion. As the decision was yet
            to be made, Brinda Keshar Shah died when he was around seven years
            old. And, Prithvi Narayan Shah became the sole heir to the
            throne.There is a popular legend about a link between King Prithvi
            Narayan Shah and Guru Gorakhnath, a god-like figure. As per the
            legend, child Shah once came across Guru Gorakhnath in the forest
            near his cave. The holy man asked him to bring some curd. Shah then
            ran to his palace and narrated everything to his mother. His mother
            handed over the curd to Shah and told him to follow what the holy
            man said. Accordingly, Shah went to the same place where he met the
            holy man. Guru Gorakhnath put the curd brought by Shah and
            regurgitated it in his hand and asked him to drink it. A confused
            and repulsed Shah rejected the offering, and the curd fell on the
            ground dribbling through his toes. Gorakhnath then said to Shah that
            he would conquer every piece of land wherever he stepped on. There
            is another myth regarding the same incident. It is believed that
            after Shah allowed the curd to fall on the ground, enraged
            Gorakhnath cursed him saying his dynasty would rule for only 10
            generations.King Prithvi Narayan Shah breathed his last at Devighat
            on the bank of the Trishuli river in Nuwakot on January 11, 1775.
            After his death, his eldest son Pratap Singh Shah continued the
            unification campaign and conquered Chitwan. But, he died soon. After
            that, his son Rana Bahadur Shah ascended the throne. He was a minor
            then; hence, his mother Rajendra Laxmi took the state power in her
            hand as a regent and gave continuity to the unification campaign.
            She annexed Lamjung, Tanahun and Kaski belonging to Chubise Rajya
            (the group of 24 states) into the Kingdom of Nepal from 1777 to
            1785. After her death, Bahadur Shah, the youngest son of Prithvi
            Narayan Shah, again as a regent to Rana Bahadur Shah, continued the
            campaign and conquered three-fourth part of Sikkim and also extended
            the eastern border to the Teesta river. He won the remaining of the
            Chaubise Rajya by 1787. He also conquested Jumla in Karnali. In
            1790, he extended the territory in the west to the Mahakali River
            annexing Doti. In the same year, he attacked Almoda, the capital of
            Kumaun, and annexed it. Next year, he attacked Srinagar, the capital
            of Garhwal and made it a subordinate state. The unification campaign
            had to be stopped due to the war with Tibet.
